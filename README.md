## [Project 1 - Coffee Sales Monthly Report, Google Looker Studio](https://github.com/nurrrcahyo/coffee_monthlyreport)
Using the same dataset I used in my earlier analysis project, I created a dashboard report with Looker Studio to show some KPIs and other interesting insights in a particular month. Although it's actually a data from a vending machine, instead of an actual coffeshop, I tried to picture it as it is a real coffeeshop.

For a quick glance to that report, I provided the screenshot below.

## [Project 2 - Chicken Noodle Customer Database (ERD & SQL Queries)](https://github.com/nurrrcahyo/mie_ayam)
In this project, I tried to imagine that I have a chicken noodle stall. To analyze my customers, I designed a simple database in hope that I could improve my sales through the data I store in this database. In this repository, I uploaded the Entity Relational Diagram (ERD) and its SQL queries to create them.

Here is the diagram,

And [here](https://github.com/nurrrcahyo/mie_ayam/blob/main/miayam_database_tables.sql) is the SQL code.

## [Project 3 - Coffee Sales Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/nurrrcahyo/coffeesales_exploratoryanalysis)
In this analysis, we will see customer behavior by looking at spending patterns, drink preferences, and arrival times, based on the payment method. By exploring these details, we get a clearer picture of how cash and card users differ in their choices and habits, helping us understand trends that could be useful for targeted decisions.

Kindly check this for [the code](https://github.com/nurrrcahyo/coffeesales_exploratoryanalysis/blob/main/coffee-sales-exploratory-analysis.ipynb) and the visualization.
